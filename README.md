# Traffic Congestion Analysis Using Machine Learning

This repositry contains the code ant resources for the project titled "Traffic Congestion Analysis Using Machine Learning." The project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and manage traffic congestion effectively.

### Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to explore the application of machine learning algorithms in analyzing and predicting traffic congestion. By utilizing a combination of supervised (Random Forest Model) and unsupervised (SMOTE) learning methods, the project aims to improve traffic flow management systems.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring the quality and relevance of the data used for model training. The following steps were undertaken:

- Data Cleaning: Removal of missing or inconsistent data entries.
- Data Transformation: Normalization and encoding of data for model compatibility.
- Feature Selection: Identification of the most relevant features for traffic prediction.

### Model Training
Various machine learning algorithms were applied to the preprocessed data to train models capable of predicting traffic congestion. The models used include:

- Supervised Learning: Regression and classification models.
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering algorithms to make a balance between congestion data and non-congestion data.

### Reuslts
The performance of the models was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings indicate that machine learning models can provide accurate and timely predictions, significantly enhancing traffic management systems.
